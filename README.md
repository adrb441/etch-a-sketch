# etch-a-sketch
This is a browser based etch-a-sketch where you can draw in the grid area by moving your mouse across it. A grid with a default of 16 x 16 squares is created and displayed on screen. A button can be used to change the number of squares displayed. The size of the grid area stays the same whether the number of squares increases or decreases.
